# Chat Persistence Test Guide

## Testing Chat State Persistence

To verify that chat history is now preserved when navigating between pages:

### Test Steps:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start your FastAPI backend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   # In your FastAPI project directory
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Test Chat Persistence**:

   **Step 1**: Go to the main chat page (`http://localhost:3000`)
   - Send a few messages to the AI
   - Verify you get responses with citations
   - Note the conversation history

   **Step 2**: Navigate to the ingest page
   - Click "Add Content" in the navigation
   - OR go directly to `http://localhost:3000/ingest`

   **Step 3**: Add some content (optional)
   - Add URLs or upload documents
   - If successful, you'll see a "Start chatting with your new content →" link

   **Step 4**: Return to chat
   - Click the "Start chatting..." link OR 
   - Click the "RAG Chat" logo/title in navigation OR
   - Navigate back to `/`

   **Step 5**: Verify persistence
   - ✅ **Expected**: Your previous conversation should still be there
   - ❌ **Previously**: Chat would be empty/reset

### Key Features Now Working:

1. **Global Chat State**: Chat messages are stored in React Context at the app level
2. **Navigation Persistence**: Moving between pages preserves chat history  
3. **Clear Chat Function**: Only the "Clear Chat" button actually clears messages
4. **Success Feedback**: Both URL ingest and document upload show success messages with "return to chat" links

### Architecture Changes Made:

- **ChatContext**: Global state management for messages
- **ChatProvider**: Wraps the entire app in `layout.tsx`
- **Updated Chat Component**: Uses global context instead of local state
- **Enhanced Success Messages**: Both ingest components now show "return to chat" links

### Debugging:

If chat still gets cleared:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ChatProvider is wrapping the app correctly
3. Ensure navigation uses Next.js `Link` components (not full page refreshes)

The chat will only be cleared when:
- User clicks "Clear Chat" button
- Browser is refreshed/reloaded
- User manually clears browser state
