# Environment Variable Fix

## Issue Fixed
The frontend was logging `"Using backend URL: undefined"` because the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment variable was not set in the `.env.local` file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `.env.local`
Added the missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` variable:
```bash
# Backend URL for the RAG API  
BACKEND_URL=https://rag-backend-bqd7.onrender.com

# Public API URL for direct frontend calls to FastAPI
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://rag-backend-bqd7.onrender.com
```

### 2. Improved `getBackendUrl()` function
- Removed excessive logging in production
- Added development-only logging
- Better fallback handling

### 3. Added Backend Configuration Validation
- Added `validateBackendConfig()` function to check URL validity
- Added helpful console warnings for configuration issues
- Integrated validation into HealthCheck component

## Environment Variables Explained

### `BACKEND_URL`
- Used by Next.js API routes (server-side)
- Not accessible in browser/client code
- Used for server-to-server communication

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- Used by client-side code (browser)
- Accessible in components and client-side logic
- Required for direct frontend-to-backend API calls

## Verification

The frontend should now properly connect to the backend at:
`https://rag-backend-bqd7.onrender.com`

You should see the backend URL logged only in development mode, and the HealthCheck component should validate the configuration on startup.
